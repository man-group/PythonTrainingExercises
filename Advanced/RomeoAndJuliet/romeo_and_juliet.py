"""Given the text for Romeo and Juliet can you predict which actor is next to speak?

There is a fair amount of code here that I have prepared for you:
play.py is the play text itself.
result.py keeps track of how well your strategy works.
parser.py reads this into Python data structures.
romeo_and_juliet.py (this file) that you can modify.

Creating a strategy:
---------------------
main() will pass you a Play() object that contains the play contents. Your job
is to create a result.Result() object then iterate throught the acts and scenes.
For each scene, given the information that you have available pass your best
guess to the result.Result() object by calling guess(actor).
That will check and record whether your guess was a good one and returns the
actual actor who will speak next at this stage of the scene (None at the end
of the scene). You are free to use this information, but remember the scene
has moved on!

At the end of the play return your result and it will be printed out to see
how accurate you were:

Here is an example where we always guess 'ROMEO':

def strat_empty(play):
    ret_val = result.Result()
    for act in play.gen_acts():
        for scene in act.gen_scenes():
            ret_val.set_act_scene(act, scene)
            while True:
                #--------- Your code starts here ------
                # What are you going to choose?
                my_choice = 'ROMEO'
                #--------- Your code ends here ------
                actual_actor = ret_val.guess(my_choice)
                if actual_actor is None:
                    break
    return ret_val

This produces the following score:

Empty strategy (always ROMEO):

   5     3      6.0     59.0      9.2%
              163.0    676.0     19.4%

Hmmm 19.4 %, can you do better?

There is one other example here which just guesses at random with predictably
poor results.

Maybe a strategy that guesses the last but one actor betting that the scene is
ROMEO/JULIET/ROMEO/JULIET/ROMEO/JULIET/ etc. Code it up!

Create your strategy by copying strat_empty(), rename it and add the call from
main(). Then add your strategy code where you see fit but don't alter the flow
of act/scene/actor or alter the lines that create result, initialise the result
for a new scene and passes your guess to the result.
