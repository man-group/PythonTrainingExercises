Python Exercises
===================

In all cases the problem is stated in the top of the code which is for you to
edit. A solution is given, usually in the solution sub-package.

Requirements
------------
These should all work with any modern version of Python (2.7 of 3.2+).

It is best if you have pytest [http://pytest.org/latest/] installed but it is not essential.

Beginners:
---------

Strings:
In the strings/strings.py there are a series of string manipulation problems.
The solutions are in strings/solution/strings.py

Functions:
Create an equivalent of the builtin functions filter and map.
The problem is stated in Functions/Functions.py
A solution is given in Functions/solution/Functions.py

Classes:
Create a class that represents a distance that can be coverted form one measure
of units to another.
The problem is stated in ClassLength/Length.py
A solution is given in ClassLength/solution/Length.py

Dictionaries
Given a dictionary that maps state name to state capital how do you do the
reverse i.e. state capital to state name.
The problem is stated in DictOfStateCapitals/StateCapitals.py
A solution is given in DictOfStateCapitals/solution/StateCapitals.py

Intermediate:
-------------

Files:
Find duplicate files on the file system.
The problem is stated in DuplicateFiles/DuplicateFiles.py
A solution is given in DuplicateFiles/solution/DuplicateFiles.py

Dictionaries:
Use a dictionary to create a histogram of floating point numbers and print it
out in a visual way.
The problem is stated in Histogram/DictHistogram.py
A solution is given in Histogram/solution/DictHistogram.py

Generators:
Create a generator that creates the infinite geometric series:
1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8... then sums the first N values or the values
until they are smaller than epsilon.
The problem is stated in Generators/Generator.py
A solution is given in Generators/solution/Generator.py

Markov Chain:
Create a class that can represent a MarkovChain
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
The problem is stated in MarkovChain/MarkovChain.py
A solution is given in MarkovChain/solution/MarkovChain.py

Random Words:
Write a function that randomises letters in words after the first N letters.
The problem is stated in RandomWords/RandomWords.py
A solution is given in RandomWords/solution/RandomWords.py

Regular Expressions:
Parse a list of lines and use regular expressions to process
them differently according to what they contain.
The problem is stated in RegexMapping/RegexMap.py
A solution is given in RegexMapping/solution/RegexMap.py


Advanced:
---------

Co-routines:
Write a co-routine that is sent words and maintains a sorted list of them.
The problem is stated in Generators/CoRoutine.py
A solution is given in Generators/solution/CoRoutine.py

Decorators:
Write a decorator that makes sure that only a particular type of exception is
raised by the function.
The problem is stated in Decorators/Decorators.py
A solution is given in Decorators/solution/Decorators.py

Create a strategy:
Given the text for Romeo and Juliet can you predict which actor is next to speak?
