"""The task is to parse a list of lines and use regular expressions to process
them differently according to what they contain.
If the line is all digits we want to convert that to an integer and divide it
by 2, if it is all non-digits then change it lower case otherwise represent it
with None.

For example, these lines:
288
ABCDEFGH
1A2B3C4D

Hello world
42

Will be converted to the list: [144, 'abcdefgh', None, None, 'hello world', 21]

The regular expression pattern for digits is \d and non-digits is \D.
